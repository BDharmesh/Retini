# Retini
A super fast and simple retina (@2x, @3x) image converter.

## How to use?
You can download the [prebuilt application from this link](https://github.com/terwanerik/Retini/blob/master/Retini.zip), or just download / fork the project and built it yourself.

After you've got the app running, you can drag single files, multiple files and directories to convert @3x or @2x images. Dragging is allowed in the Retini window aswell as the App Icon in the Dock.

The resized images will be placed in the same directory as the source file.
